<h2>Statement_of_Work | Technical_Resource_Objective spreadsheet templates</h2>


In some of our experiences, DBA / Development work on a project is significant. However the process procurement of a DBA[s] / developer[s] as resources are quite informal, say a casual email or word to our managers.


For individual DBAs / Developers without access to formal work tracking software like JIRA / Confluence / etc, a [Statement_Of_Work](https://github.com/psZh3ePNj0/Oracle_Goodies/blob/main/Knowledge-Transfer/Statement_of_Work/SoW_Template.xlsx) helps:

  - Formalize a DBA / Developer efforts for a project with timelines and deliverables
  - Identify all stakeholders involved and secure their signoff
  - Provide scope for areas <b>[here the comment section]</b> of unexpected delays / additional effort which can impact deliverable timelines



Similarly for the DBA / Development Lead, a [Technical_Resource_Objective](https://github.com/psZh3ePNj0/Oracle_Goodies/blob/main/Knowledge-Transfer/Statement_of_Work/Technical_Resource_Objective_Template.xlsx) can provide higher level tracking for DBA / Development projects of a team with tabs for Active / On Hold projects.
