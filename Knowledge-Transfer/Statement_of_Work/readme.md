In some of our experiences, DBA / Development is significant, however the process procurement of DBAs / developers as resources are quite informal, say a casual email or word to our managers]. For those of us without access to formal work tracking software like JIRA / Confluence / etc, a <Statement_of_Work> documents helps:

  - Identify all stakeholders involved and secure their signoff.
  - Areas [comment sections] for unforeseen delays / additional effort which can impact deliverable timelines.
