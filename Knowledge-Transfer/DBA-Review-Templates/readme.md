<h2> DBA REVIEW | PROCESS FLOW (SQL Scripts) </h2>

<h3>$$\color{blue}Overview:$$</h3>

Peer Review of any coding efforts is genuinely a best practice approach. 
Many organisational shops will have at least 1-tier of peer review for code.

Multi-tier review $$\color{blue}(ex: \space Developer \space Peer \space Review \space -> \space DBA \space Peer \space review)$$ 
provides an additional set of eyes in the review and additional check points as DBAs provide insight, 
that based on their disciple, may not be covered in the initial review.



Below is some critical categories a DBA will use in SQL scripts review. 

- $$\color{blue}Script \space Validation$$

- $$\color{blue}Rollback$$

- $$\color{blue}User \space Acceptance \space Testing$$
