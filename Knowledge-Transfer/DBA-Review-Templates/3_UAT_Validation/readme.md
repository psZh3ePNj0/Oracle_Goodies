<br>


UAT / QA SignOff focuses around an organisations $$\color{blue} User \space Acceptance \space | \space Quality \space Assurance$$ application testing and
signoff from the changes made in a non-Production Environment. If best practices are followed, the User Acceptance | Quality Assurance will action:

- $$\color{blue}User \space Acceptance \space Testing \space and \space Signoff$$
- $$\color{blue}Regression \space Testing \space and \space Signoff$$
- $$\color{blue}Impact \space Analysis \space (System \space | \space Application) \space Validation \space and \space Signoff$$
- $$\color{blue}Risk \space Assessment \space Validation \space and \space Signoff$$
<br>  

For a DBA, we need to ascertain if the various signoffs orrurred. This could be though:
- Direct access to the documents with UAT / QA personnel signoff points
- Change Management Tracking System verification like $$\color{blue}SCCD \space | \space SERVICE \space NOW$$
